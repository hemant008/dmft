					<h4><a href="#">health care</a></h4>
					<p>Rural hospitals are a critical, yet vulnerable, part of our national healthcare delivery system.
					They provide emergency department services, inpatient care, outpatient care, long-term care,
					and care coordination services. Unique circumstances, characteristics, and challenges of rural hospitals
					have resulted in different approaches to healthcare than those used in an urban environment.</p>
